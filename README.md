# Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning
This project demonstrates the use of Machine Learning techniques to predict future sales based on historical customer purchasing behavior data. A Linear Regression model was developed to analyze patterns in the dataset and forecast sales outcomes.<br> 
The objective of this project is to transform raw customer data into meaningful business insights that support data-driven decision-making.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze customer purchasing behavior data
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Build and train a regression model for sales prediction
- Evaluate model performance using R-squared metric
- Visualize actual vs predicted results

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

---

## Dataset 
**Customer Purchasing Behaviors**

The dataset contains customer-related features such as:
- Region
- Customer attributes
- Purchase-related metrics
- Target variable (Sales)

---

## ML Model
Linear Regression


## Model Evaluation
- Performance Metric: **R-squared Score**
- R² measures how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.
- Higher R² indicates better model performance.

---

## Data Visualization
- Scatter plot representing actual data points
- Regression line representing predicted values
- Visualization created using Matplotlib
